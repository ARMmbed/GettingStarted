# Introduction

Welcome to the getting started guides for ARM® mbed™ OS. 

## Getting mbed OS

We don't "get" mbed OS in the same way that we get a new app on our phone. There is no mbed OS download and no way to install it on our machine.

Working with mbed OS means we use yotta to combine our own application code with the mbed OS code base. yotta gets the relevant parts of mbed OS for us from its own registry.

So these guides will walk you through working with yotta, then show you how to write an application that can work with the mbed OS code base. 

For yotta installation instructions, see the [installation section](installation.md).

## The quick guides

* [Getting started with mbed OS](GettingStartedmbedOS.md): What's new with mbed OS, and how to write and build programs for it.

* [Your first mbed OS application](FirstProjectmbedOS.md): a simple example to get you going.

## The mbed OS user guide

This guide isn't ready yet, but we're publishing stand-alone chapters as fast as we can. 

Currently only one chapter is available: [mbed OS applications with yotta](Full_Guide/app_on_yotta.md). It explains the relation between yotta and mbed OS, and how you can create yotta-based mbed OS applications.

## Additional sources

* [Further reading sources](FurtherReading.md) about other mbed tools, hardware, community and partners.

* Links to [our main code repositories and their documentation](GetTheCode.md).
