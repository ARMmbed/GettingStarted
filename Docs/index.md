# Introduction

Welcome to the getting started guides for ARM® mbed™ OS. 

## The quick guides

* [Setting up your machine to work with mbed OS](installation.md).

* [An introudction to mbed OS](GettingStartedmbedOS.md): What's new with mbed OS, and how to write and build programs for it.

* [Your first mbed OS application](FirstProjectmbedOS.md): a simple example to get you going.

## The mbed OS user guide

This guide isn't ready yet, but we're publishing stand-alone chapters as fast as we can. 

Currently only one chapter is available: [mbed OS applications with yotta](Full_Guide/app_on_yotta.md). It explains the relation between yotta and mbed OS, and how you can create yotta-based mbed OS applications.

## Additional sources

* [Further reading sources](FurtherReading.md) about other mbed tools, hardware, community and partners.

* Links to [our main code repositories and their documentation](GetTheCode.md).
