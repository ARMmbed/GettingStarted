# Getting started with mbed

Welcome to mbed's getting started guides.

mbed is our general term that encompasses our mbed website, mbed Operating System (mbed OS), mbed Client, mbed TLS and more.

## mbed OS

mbed OS is our operating system for Cortex-M based embedded devices.

In order to get you started with mbed OS, please have a look at:

* [Getting started with mbed OS](GettingStartedOS.md): What's new with mbed OS, and how to write and build programs for it.

* [Your first mbed OS project](FirstProjectOS.md): a simple project to get you going.

* [The migration guide](MigrationGuide.md): get your existing libraries and application to yotta, our new build system.

## mbed Client

mbed Client allows you to easily connect your devices to the client via the mbed Connector. For now mbed Client is only delivered as part of mbed OS. In the near future mbed Client will be available as a separate software product. We will then provide specific guides to get your started with mbed Client in this section.

## mbed TLS

mbed TLS makes it trivially easy for developers to include cryptographic and SSL/TLS capabilities in their (embedded) products, facilitating this functionality with a minimal coding code footprint. It offers an SSL library with an intuitive API and readable source code, and includes an elaborate test suite. You can build it out of the box on most systems, or manually select and configure features.

In order to get you started with mbed TLS, please have a look at:
* [mbed TLS Tutorial](https://tls.mbed.org/kb/how-to/mbedtls-tutorial): A tutorial on using mbed TLS in a standalone project
* [Security in mbed OS](http://mbed.com/en/technologies/security/): Security Technologies available in mbed OS
