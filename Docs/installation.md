# Installation

mbed OS works on your board, so you don't install it on your computer. What you need is a tool that takes your application code and the mbed OS code, then builds it into a single file that you can put on your board. That tool is called yotta, so yotta is what you need to install on your computer.

Once you've installed yotta, you can start building your applications. We explain the full process [in our review of yotta projects](Full_Guide/app_on_yotta.md).

There are two ways to work with yotta: 

* [Install it on your machin](http://yottadocs.mbed.com/#installing).

* [Run it in a Docker container](docker_install.md).
